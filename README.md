# AI_Search_Algorithms
Implemetation of popular AI seach algorithms

Implementation of the three most popular search algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle game.
The algorithms include:
  1) bfs (Breadth-First Search)
  2) dfs (Depth-First Search)
  3) ast (A-Star Search)


The board argument will be a comma-separated list of integers containing no spaces. 
For example, to use the bread-first search strategy to solve the board given by the intial state {0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1}, 
the program will be executed like so (with no spaces between commas):

$ python3 driver.py bfs 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
